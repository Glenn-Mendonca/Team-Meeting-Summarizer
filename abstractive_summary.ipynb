As you all know, since Covid-19 struck the World Online Meeting classes shifted online, even though the transition was hard, people now feel a comfort of attending meetings from anywhere in the world, but people still need to keep track important information during these online meetings. Next, So online. Meet the progress of each student on the basis of the response. It important information discussed during an on fist meeting please. Of help of it would help to ease the work of students and teachers and make the work has been free. What \n",

That makes by providing useful insights like what's per minute engagement of Next. Towards Anna, Nidovico and Onresgoja. This Has a theoretical and descriptive basis for minutes. This paper mainly contents methods that can be used for summarization by training, done us, whatever data sets. Summary, foundation for research into automatic meditating of minutes. The main goal is to prepare the flow for automatic managing finalizing the sources. reliable. By comparing a variety of types. They have tried to get a reasonable typology of meetings summarize the types of describes the minute, the grassettes and made a survey of summarization. They also have drafted, the first steps to the creation of meetings and minutes, which will be further used for developing automatic The paper has a following research gaps. this theoretical knowledge about various methods of meeting summarization or However, it lacks using the summarized data to further scheduled Basically, to check if desired meeting objective is met, \n",

The solution offered is to implement a web-based application, which can record the voice of meeting participants then So, the result of the recording process of the meeting material more effective and efficient next and features for speech processing. The year they were they have proposed a new human voice recognition system. Next, In this study, a chrome used for making the process of transcription hassle-free. It uses generate concise matter. This paper illustrates can be traced from online meetings. Over to Glen. \n",

In web, scraping Scraping, we take the captions generated by the meet interface and compile them into a file, Whereas, in speech to text, we use natural language processing to convert the the speech to text method, uses more resources deployed in the client machine.

        "Thank you, Glenn. Coming to the next major component of our application which is summarization. Basically, summarization based on the transcript generated extractive summarization and Extractive summarization involves picking up the most important and lines from the text. Then combining all the important lines to create It is quick and easy to implement as it only has to identify important filler words and phrases. It is a comparatively better option the entire summary is needed. methods of people learning. It finds patterns in the test and the points, and meaning same. It takes implement. That is a disadvantage of abstract of fine. Tuning also takes time However, it is When a new insight is needed, that could have gotten missed when using extractive Now coming to a conclusion methods used. \n",

        "as of now we have implemented web scraping using selenium to extract transitive generated by Google Meet In the coming few weeks, we will be implementing a deep learning-based model for traditional using NLP. Or making use of predefined APIs like text. using a custom space to text will allow us to Google Meet. However, distinguishing every individual's During transcript, generation will be a challenging task. in the previous slide, each of the two types have their own demerits however, we are yet to decide which of the two to implement in our application While extractive is easier to implement, it provides a rather summary of the input Meanwhile, abstractive summarization of text. and is rather difficult. Coming to the softwares used. We have learning and its various sub-library libraries such as scikit-learn, numpy, Python take, inter library for using the or using to to build the user interface. Google Tensorflow for building a model that is yet to be implemented. Python Language Processing, for summarization of the transcript. Beautiful Soup Python Library for passing HTML. application. Any minutes of a meeting, includes the following namely corporation date and time of meeting list of attendees. the meet. In the end, it consists of an abstractive summary of the entire transcript written by the person responsible. As that is our human text. for summarization, we will be using classification machine algorithms, some of which are support vector machines, knife base, random forest, neighbors and logistic regression. entire application. Meeting will be created by who will have this application running on his or her site transcript generation, currently from HTML, elements of Google Meet, instead of processing as mentioned here. Some of the features of our apps overview. That is review the entire transcript and give a brief abstractive summary of insights important dates, discussed and saved as entire sentences. the meet which will also be editable. analytics, such as duration meat number of participants spoken etc. Some other features minute real time and status of the meet, which you could be engaging, active, number of people, speaking number of words of words, individual etc. it will also include new every time a different person speaks during the transcript generation since functionality is this software can be used across all Web meetings regardless of any permissions.
